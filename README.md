# Tribute Page App

This is a web application that aims to replicate the functionality of [https://tribute-page.freecodecamp.rocks](https://tribute-page.freecodecamp.rocks). It is a tribute page that provides information about a subject and includes an image, caption, and link to additional information.

## User Stories

1. **Main Element**: As a user, I can see a `main` element with a corresponding id of `main`, which contains all other elements of the tribute page.
2. **Title Element**: As a user, I can see an element with an id of `title` that contains a string describing the subject of the tribute page, e.g., "Dr. Norman Borlaug".
3. **Image Element**: As a user, I can see a `figure` or `div` element with an id of `img-div` that contains the following:
   - Image: An `img` element with a corresponding id of `image` is provided, which displays an image related to the subject of the tribute page.
     - The `img` element should be centered within its parent element.
     - The `img` element should use `max-width` and `height` properties to resize responsively relative to the width of its parent element without exceeding its original size.
   - Caption: An element with a corresponding id of `img-caption` is provided, which contains textual content describing the image shown in `img-div`.
4. **Tribute Info Element**: As a user, I can see an element with a corresponding id of `tribute-info`, which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.
5. **Tribute Link Element**: As a user, I can see an `a` element with a corresponding id of `tribute-link`, which links to an outside site containing additional information about the subject of the tribute page.
   - The `a` element should have an attribute of `target` set to `_blank` to open the link in a new tab.

## Technologies Used

This web application was built using HTML5 and CSS3 for front-end development. It utilizes HTML5 elements such as `main`, `figure`, `img`, `a`, and CSS3 for styling and layout. The application includes responsive design techniques using `max-width` and `height` properties to ensure the image resizes properly relative to its parent element. The `target` attribute is used to open the link in a new tab.
